Using objdump on the map executable. Which of the addresses from the previous section are defined in the executable, and which segment is each defined in?
A: Addresses of statically allocated data is visible in the dump namely addresses of "foo" and "stuff". They are in the .data segment.
There are also functions "main" and "recur" in the .text segment.

Make a list of the important segments, and what they are used for.
A: Perhaps not most important but most significant to me are:
.text for functions.
.data for variables

What direction is the stack growing in?
A: Negative direction (numbers are increasing).

How large is the stack frame for each recursive call?
A: 48 bits

Where is the heap? What direction is it growing in?
A: The heap is shown by the calls to malloc. it is growing in a positive direction.

Are the two malloc()ed memory areas contiguous?
A: It would appear as though there is 12 bits between them, perhaps to store a pointer to the next variable.
